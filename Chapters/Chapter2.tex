\section{Finite Element Method (FEM) \parencite{ref4}}
In general, it is difficult to find an analytic solution that satisfies the variational
equation in the previous section. Instead, the FEM divides the entire domain into a
set of simple sub-domains or finite elements. The finite elements are connected with
adjacent elements by sharing their nodes. Then within each finite element, the
solution is approximated in a simple polynomial form.

FEMs for structural analysis require knowledge of the behavior of each element
in the structure. In this section, a structural analysis based on the finite element
approach is introduced using three-dimensional solid elements. Finite element for-
mulations for other structural elements, such as bars, beams, and plates, etc . Apart from the moreintricate algebra that is required for more complex elements, the basic approach for
deriving element equations is identical to the process illustrated in this section.
Once each element is described, the governing equations of the entire structure may
then be derived.

\section{Finite Element Approximation \parencite{ref4}}
Differential equations and variational equations, introduced in (\ref{theory}) page \pageref{theory},
are difficult to solve, except for a handful of simple cases. When the geometry is
complicated, it is not trivial to solve for u(x) analytically. Since the solution that
satisfies the differential equation and boundary conditions can have a complicated
expression, an infinite series solution may need to be employed. In the FEM, instead
of solving the variational equation analytically, an approximate solution is sought.
The approximate solution u(x) is expressed as a sum of a number of functions that
are called trial functions:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:1}
u(x) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{c_i}} {\phi _i}(x){\rm{ }}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of terms used, $\phi_i(x)$ are known trial functions, and $c_i$ are
coefficients to be determined by minimizing error between the true and the approxi-
mate solution. Since the approximate solution is a linear combination of the trial
functions, the accuracy of approximation depends on them.
\vspace{0.38cm}
\newline
The trial functions and coefficients are chosen such that $u(x)$ must satisfy the
essential boundary conditions of the problem; that is, $u(x)$ must belong to the
space of kinematically admissible displacements, $\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, if the solution to
the variational equation is approximated by a series of functions in the entire domain
of the problem, it is difficult to obtain the trial functions that satisfy the essential
boundary conditions. An important idea of the FEM is to divide the entire domain
into a set of simple sub-domains or finite elements and then to apply the approximation 
in Eq. (\ref{eqn:1}) on the element level. Then, it is unnecessary to build the trial
functions that satisfy the essential boundary conditions. Instead, only those elements
that include the essential boundary conditions need to have a special treatment.
The finite elements are connected with adjacent elements by sharing their nodes.
Then within each finite element, the solution is approximated using a simple
polynomial form. For example, let us assume that the domain is one-dimensional
and the exact solution is given as a dashed curve in Fig. \ref{fig:Piecewise}. When the entire domain is divided into sub-domains (finite elements), it is possible to approximate the
solution using piecewise continuous linear polynomials as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Piecewise}.
Within each element, the approximate solution is linear. Two adjacent elements
have the same solution value at the shared node. As can be seen in the figure, when
more numbers of elements are used, the approximate piecewise linear solution will
converge to the exact solution. In addition, the approximation can be more accurate
if higher-order polynomials are used in each element.\\
